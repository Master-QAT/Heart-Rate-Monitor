# Heart-Rate-Monitor
A smart health monitoring system using ESP32 + MAX30100 sensor with OLED display and buzzer alerts. Built for wearable health applications by Master QAT
# Heart Rate Monitoring System with ESP32 & MAX30100

## Short Description  
This project is a heart rate monitoring system built with an **ESP32** and the **MAX30100 pulse oximeter sensor**.  
It measures heart rate in real time and provides visual/audio feedback using an OLED display and a buzzer.  
The system can be used for basic health tracking and wearable tech applications.  

## Features  
- Real-time heart rate measurement using MAX30100.  
- Displays heart rate on an OLED screen.  
- Adjustable sensitivity using a potentiometer.  
- Buzzer alert with tone when abnormal readings are detected.  
- Portable and low-power, ideal for wearable health monitoring.  

## Components Used  
### Hardware  
- **ESP32** â€“ Microcontroller for processing and connectivity.  
- **MAX30100 Sensor** â€“ Pulse oximeter for heart rate detection.  
- **OLED Display (SSD1306)** â€“ Shows real-time heart rate readings.  
- **Buzzer** â€“ Provides tone alerts for warnings.  
- **Potentiometer** â€“ Adjusts sensitivity or threshold levels.  
- **Jumper wires & breadboard** â€“ For circuit connections.  

### Software  
- **Arduino IDE** â€“ Programming environment.  
- **ESP32 Board Package** â€“ For compiling and uploading code to ESP32.  
- **MAX30100 Library** â€“ Sensor data processing.  
- **Adafruit SSD1306 & GFX Libraries** â€“ For OLED display control.  

##  How It Works  
1. The MAX30100 sensor detects the userâ€™s heart rate via fingertip measurement.  
2. The ESP32 reads and processes the sensor data.  
3. The heart rate value is displayed on the OLED screen.  
4. The buzzer generates a tone when readings exceed set thresholds.  
5. The potentiometer lets the user adjust sensitivity for testing.
